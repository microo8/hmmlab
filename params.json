It can create, edit, train and visualize HMMs. HMMLab supports loading/saving HMMs from/to HTK files.\r\n\r\n## Compilation\r\n\r\nBefore compilation you must install:\r\n\r\n * [SWIG](http://swig.org/>)\r\n * [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)\r\n * [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)\r\n * [Libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/)\r\n * [PyGObject](https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject/) for **Python3**.\r\n\r\nYou must use **Python3**.\r\n\r\nGo to ``hmmlab/`` directory:\r\n\r\n>  $ python3 setup.py build\r\n\r\n>  $ sudo python3 setup.py install\r\n\r\nNow you have a script in `/usr/bin` named `hmmlab`.\r\n\r\nOr on a rpm distibution you can simply download the rpm package in the [dist](https://github.com/microo8/hmmlab/tree/master/dist>) section. It will install all dependencies.\r\n\r\nYou must create a configuration file in `~/.config/hmmlab.conf` and it might look like:\r\n\r\n>  [mainwindow]\r\n\r\n>  width = 800\r\n\r\n>  height = 600\r\n\r\n>  [model]\r\n\r\n>  width = 80\r\n\r\n>  height = 40\r\n\r\nRunning `$ hmmlab` will start the **HMMLab** application. Have fun :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
